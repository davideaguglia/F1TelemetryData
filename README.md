# F1 Telemetry Data
## What is this project about?
The idea is that of combining data visualization and BI tools, along with python libraries to create an interactive dashboard to make it easy for everyone to access and analyze F1 Telemetry Data. For every year and every race or qualifying we can display significant metrics that describes the event, with the help of useful and interactive visualizations.

## Tools
This dashboard is written in python, making use of two powerful libraries, that are: 
* #### [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash)
  Dash is a python framework that allows to create data science webb apps, creating interactive and meaningful visualization for any dataset. It is a powerful and flexible tool that    combines the flexibility of Python with the dynamic capabilities of web technologies, allowing users to create complex, interactive interfaces
* #### [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) 
  FastF1 is a python package for accessing and analyzing Formula 1 results, schedules, timing data and telemetry. It provides easy access to rich, real-time F1 data, making it ideal    for performance analysis, strategy evaluation, and fan-driven insights.
